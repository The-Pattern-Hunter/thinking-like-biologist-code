# Data Files

**Important Note:** These are example datasets based on research patterns described in "Thinking Like a Biologist with Data." They reflect realistic biological relationships discussed in the text but are created for educational purposes rather than representing actual research data.

## About the Example Datasets

Each dataset is designed to:
- Demonstrate statistical concepts from the corresponding chapter
- Reflect realistic biological patterns and relationships
- Provide hands-on practice with R code
- Maintain biological plausibility while being educationally focused

## Files:
- chapter1-olive-ridley.csv: Example turtle nesting data reflecting patterns discussed in Dr. Sharma's research narrative
- chapter2-mangrove-heights.csv: Sample tree height measurements illustrating distribution concepts
- chapter3-hornbill-census.csv: Example bird survey data for group comparison methods
- Additional datasets will be added for each chapter following the same educational approach

## Usage
These datasets are designed to work seamlessly with the R code provided in the `/code` folder. Students can download both the data and code to practice the statistical concepts covered in each chapter.
